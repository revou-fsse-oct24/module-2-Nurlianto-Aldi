6. For asymetrical grid, i add GALLERY at navigation bar that link to the compilation of image. I made this gallery using display: grid; and made it asymetrcial using :nth-child(3n - 2). I also add the zoom effect when the cursor pointed at the image using transition.

8. I add the transition at navigation link, button, and image in gallery.html. Since animation doesn't fit in my web concept, i do not add the animation using keyframes (believe me, i try make a ball bouncing but i can't think where i should put it so i'm not including it; but i add it in the code but commented it so it doesn't appear on the website)

note: i can't show you the before and after of the transition because i'm using sniiping tools. Please, just try it by yourslef.

another note : i update this assignment in Novemebr 11 2024 because i'm not confidence enough to show it to anyone. Since the final checkpoint need to deploy the website (means everyone can see it) then i fix my website and ready to deploy. Thanks for the understanding.
